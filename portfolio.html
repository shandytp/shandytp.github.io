    <h1>Portfolio and Experience</h1>

    <h2>Pacmann</h2>
    <p>2021 - now</p>
    <p>In Pacmann, I'm working as Lecturer and Data Engineer</p>

    <h3>As Data Engineer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Of course building Data Pipeline. Because Data Pipeline is my passion‚òùÔ∏èüî•‚ú®üó£Ô∏è</li>
        <li>Nah, but in serious note Data Engineer is fun field for me that really sucks at math. hehe</li>
        <li>Because building Data Pipeline, usually I will do requirements gathering to understanding what's stakeholder pain, needs, and give them my solutions</li>
        <li>Before implement Data Pipeline, I will discuss with my peers how's the flow to data, data architecture, transformation rules, etc</li>
        <li>I've already built Data Pipeline to get data from source like Odoo, Database, and Spreadsheet</li>
        <li>After that, the data is transformed then dump it to Data Warehouse that later can be used for Reporting, Dashboarding, ML Model, etc</li>
        <li>By using my Data Pipeline, it cut all manual process like get data from database and write it to spreadsheet. It's all automated baby in this pipeline üòé</li>
        <li>It's not the best solution because there's still a room to improve. I learn a lot about Data Pipeline, Data Architect, and how to create proper documentation</li>
        <li>It's a really fun project for me. Because my data product is used by other team for business decisions! Bangga cuk bisa bikin gituan</li>
        <li>Oh yeah, I also create small data pipeline that extract data from database then write it to Spreadsheet that later use by Ops Team to create Dashboard in Looker</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>As Lecturer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Because I'm lecturer, my experience is creating material for Pacmann's studentsüòÖ</li>
        <li>In Pacmann's not only teach about tools, but also teach the "philosophy" and theory why you build this data product</li>
        <li>I'm not expect that I helps more than 1000 students in the courses</li>
        <li>I forgot, I also become Mentor (lol) and helps more than 100 students by guiding them in their exercises and students side project</li>
        <li>Sometimes by request I wrote a Twitter content for <a href="https://x.com/pacmannai" target="_blank">@pacmannai</a> in Data Engineering topics like Data Wrangling, SQL, Python, how to build Data Engineer Portfolio, and many more</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Valiance</h2>
    <p>2023 - now</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obviously it's NDA Stuff, but mainly creating Data Pipeline and Monitoring</li>
        <li>Create Data Pipeline to Extract data from Indonesian Law Agencies data source like API, Database, and CDC using Apache NiFi</li>
        <li>Data Pipeline can process data roughly 5 millions records in one day</li>
        <li>Besides creating Data Pipeline, also designing Data Quality that can be used to tract the quality of the data source before process by Data Pipeline</li>
        <li>Cleansing, Transforming, and Mapping values (using Pandas) from Indonesian Army Agencies that later used for Dashboard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Side Project for fun</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/shandytp/scraping-catalog-comifuro" target="_blank">Scraping Catalog Comifuro</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create Data Pipeline (again...) using Python script to scrape the information about Comifuro's Catalog</li>
        <li>Write the scraping results to Google Spreadsheet and create a simple Dashboard</li>
        <li>Using cron scheduler to run the script everyday</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/shandytp/scraping-dapil-pemilu" target="_blank">Scraping Dapil Pemilu Data</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrape Data Pemilu DPD and DPRD using API</li>
        <li>Clean the API results to readable format using Pandas</li>
        <li>The data is used by other team to create an analysis for creating new product</li>
    </ul>
